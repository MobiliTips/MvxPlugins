1. Into the Setup class, add:

        protected override IMvxPhoneViewPresenter CreateViewPresenter(PhoneApplicationFrame rootFrame)
        {
            Forms.Init();

            var presenter = new MvxFormsWindowsPhoneViewPresenter(new MvxFormsApp(), rootFrame);
            Mvx.RegisterSingleton<IMvxViewPresenter>(presenter);

            return presenter;
        }
        
        
2. You can now delete no more needed files like all views except BaseView.cs

3. Enjoy! :)
