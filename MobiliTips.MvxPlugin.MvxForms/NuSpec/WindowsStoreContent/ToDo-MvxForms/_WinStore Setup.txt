1. Into the OnLaunched method of the App class, add:

                Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(args);

		before:

		if (args.PreviousExecutionState == ApplicationExecutionState.Terminated)


2. Into the Setup class, add:

        protected override IMvxWindowsViewPresenter CreateViewPresenter(IMvxWindowsFrame rootFrame)
        {
            var presenter = new MvxFormsWindowsStoreViewPresenter(new MvxFormsApp(), rootFrame);
            Mvx.RegisterSingleton<IMvxViewPresenter>(presenter);

            return presenter;
        }
        
        
3. You can now delete no more needed files like all views except BaseView.cs

4. Enjoy! :)
