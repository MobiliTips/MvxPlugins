1. Update/Create your Model classes so that they all inherit from EntityData abstract class 
or ITableData if there's another parent class yet (see online documentation for tutorials).

If your Model classes are not hosted by this project, you also need to install this nuget plugin into it (and remove config files from it).

2. Update MvxAmsPluginConfiguration class with your own Azure URL and Key.

[Optional] If your Model classes are not hosted by this project, you have to change ModelAssembly default value to: 
	
	ModelAssembly = typeof(NAME_OF_ANY_MODEL_CLASS).GetTypeInfo().Assembly;

[Optional] If you want to change the initialization timeout default value to a custom one, set:

	InitTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60);

3. You can now resolve IMvxAmsService from anywhere to use it (see online documentation for tutorials)


NB: If you want to manage local data thanks to LocalTable<T> and Push methods
you have to install the MvvmCross - Azure Mobile Services plugin Local Store extension


Enjoy!
